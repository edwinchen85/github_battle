# [GitHub Battle](https://reacttraining.com/online/react-fundamentals)

From the course series of React Fundamental by React Training, we are going to learn to use React.js to code a project called GitHub Battle.

GitHub Battle is a web app that allows user to pick two contestants (github_username) to match up against each other in terms of their GitHub popularity. We will also code a page that show popular GitHub repos among popular programming languages such as JavaScript, Ruby, Java, CSS and Python.

Among the React technologies we'll learn are:
1. React
2. React Router
3. Webpack
4. Babel
5. Axios
